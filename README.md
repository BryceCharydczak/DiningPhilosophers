# **DiningPhilosophers**

A repository dedicated to the development of the Dining Philosophers dilemma.  Our project is a visualization of this dilmma through the management of threads.  This software could be used to help illustrate the philosophers dilemma to students and teachers alike in order to assist in learning.

# *Explaining the Process*

This implementation of the Dining Philosophers Deadlock scenario is developed using python and external libraries (<insert used libraries here>) in order to simulate the deadlock scenario while updating a GUI to display the processes actually taking place.
